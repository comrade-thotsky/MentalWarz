Here is the functionality of the game that is confirmed.
This is going to be a platformer game, like Big Tower Tiny Square.
Instead of scrolling through as you go, it is going to be one screen and then you will move to the next screen, (The first type is too big brain).
The sprites will be boxes and divs, the style will be simple.
We need to keep everything at 620px width, 480px height.
